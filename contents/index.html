<p>
Hi! I am Gail Weiss, a postdoc at EPFL, working in the <a href="https://nlp.epfl.ch">NLP lab</a> of <a href="https://atcbosselut.github.io">Prof. Antoine Bosselut</a>. Before that, I was a PhD student at the Technion working with <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~yahave/">Prof. Eran Yahav</a> and <a href="https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/">Prof. Yoav Goldberg</a>. My main research interest at the moment is in understanding sequential neural networks (such as RNNs and transformers) through the lens of formal language theory, whether in order to extract more interpretable models (such as deterministic finite automata from RNNs), or understand what such interpretable models should even be (as in the case of transformers).

<p>
Outside of computer science, my interests include baking, drawing, and <a href="https://twitter.com/gail_w/status/1032668997970546695">chasing pigeons off my windowsill</a>. For a glorious few years, I <a href="files/mimuna-2019.jpg">ran the <q>kitchen</q></a> for the Technion CS faculty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimouna">Mimuna</a>&mdash;the end of Passover celebration&mdash;during which various helpful students and I made hundreds of mufleta for all of our students, faculty, and staff.

I am reachable at gail dot weiss at epfl.ch.

<h4>Note: The Formal Languages and Neural Networks (FLaNN) Discord</h4>

<p>
(Oct 2022): This last year, we have grown a small discord group for people interested in the intersection of Formal Language Theory, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, from which we organise and record a seminar. Recently some co-organisers even made us a website (!) : <a href="http://flann.super.site/">http://flann.super.site/</a> 
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in joining this group, you can send an email to me or one of my co-organisers (listed on the site), and we will be happy to get back to you with a link! And if you just want to listen from afar, we upload our recorded talks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrp8k-nSuMKHM4sSUvlPdAw">this youtube channel</a>, which you can enjoy at your leisure :)
